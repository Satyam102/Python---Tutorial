A program is a set of instructions that govern the processing.
	                    OR
A program forms the base for processing.

Python Character: Python Character is set of valid chatactes that a language can recognize. Python support Uncode encoding standard. 
That means, Python has the following character set:
	    (i)Letters : A-Z, a-z
	    (ii)Digits : 0-9
	    (iii)Special symbols : space + -* / ** // == = "" '' : ; % ! & # <= >= < ,> . {} [] () @ _(underscore)
	    (iv)Whitespaces : Blank space, tabs, carriage return, newline, formfeed.
	    (v)Other character : Python can process all ASCII and unicode character as part of data or literals.
	    
Tokens: The smallest individual unit in a program is known as a token or lexical unit.
	    There are five types of tokens:
	                        (1) Keywords
	                        (2) Idntifiers
	                        (3) Literals 
	                        (4) Operators
	                        (5) Punctuators
	                        
	
(1) Keywords : A keyword is a having special meaning reversed by programming language.
	Python programming language comtains the following keywords:
	        False    True     elif      else    if    while etc.
	
(2) Ietifiers(Name) : Name of vriables/functions.
	              (i) A to Z alphabets a to z
	              (ii) 0-9
	              (iii) _(underscore)
	
(3) Literals : Literals are data items that have a fixed value. Python allow several kinds of literals :
	    (a) String Literals.
	    (b) Numeric litersls.
	    (c) Boolean literals.
	    (d) Special literals None.
	    (e) Literal collections.
	
	(a)String literals : A string literals is a sequence of character surrounded by quotes (singal or double or tripal quotes).
	String types in Python : Python allow two type of string types : (i) Single-line Strings
	                                                                 (ii) Multi-line Strings
	
	    (i) Single-line strings : The string that you create by enclosing text in single ('') or double ("") quotes.
	    (ii) Multi-line strings : The string that you create by enclosing text in tripal (''') quotes are called multi-line string.
	          Multi-line string can be created in two ways 
	          I. By adding backslash at the end of normal single or double quotes.
	          II. By typing triple quotes marks (No backslash needed at the end line).
	
	(b) Numeric string : The numeric literals in Python can belong to any of the following there different numerical types:
	        int (single integer value)
	        float (floating point real values)
	        complex (complex number)
	
	(c) Boolean literals : True or False are the only two Boolean literals values in Python. None literals represents absence of a value.
	
	(d) Special literals None : The None valuein Python means "There is useful information" or "There is nothing here".
	
	
(4)Operators : Operators are tokens that trigger some computation/action when applied to variable and other objects in an expression.
	
	  Unary Operators : Unary operators are those operators that require one operand to operate that require one operand to operate upon. 
	  Following some are unary operators:
	        +     Unary plus
	        -     Unary minus
	        ~     Bitwise complement
	        not   Logical negation
	
  Binary Operators : Binary operators are those operators that required two operands to operate upon.Following ae some binary opeartors:
	      Arithmetic Operators:
	                +   Addition
	                -   Subtraction
	                *   Multiplication
	                /   Division
	                %   Remainder/Modulus
	                **  Exponent (raise to the power)
	                //  Floor division
	        
	      Bitwise Operators:
	                &   Bitwise AND
	                ^   Bitwise exclusive OR (X OR)
	                |   Bitwise OR
	      
	      Shift Operators:
	                <<  Shift left
	                >>  Shift right
	      
	      Identity Operators:
	               is       is the identity same?
	               is not   is the identity not same?
	      
	      Relational Operators:
	               <    less than
	               >    greater than
	               <=   less than equal to
	               >=   greater than equal to
	               ==   equal to
	               !=   not equal to
	      
	      Assignment Operators:
	              =     assignment
	              /=    assign quoient
	              +=    assign sum
	              *=    assign product
	              -=    assign difference
	              //=   assign floor division
	              **=   assig exponent
	      
	      Logical Operators:
	              and     logical AND
	              or      logical OR
	      
	      Membership Operators:
	              in        wheather variable in sequence
	              not in    wheather variable not in sequence.
	 
(5) Punctuators : Punctuators are symbols that are used in programming languages.
	  Most common punctuators of Python programming language are :
	        ' " # \ () {} [] @ : . ` =
	
Variable : A variable is defined only when you assign some value to it.
	
Dynamic Typing : A varibles pointing to a value of a certain type, can be made to point t a value/object of differnt type. 
This type is called dynamic typing. For example:
	              x = 10
	              print(x)
	              x = 20
	              print(x)
	              x = "Python"
	              print(x)
	     Above code will yield the output as:
	              10
	              20
	              Python
